# CSC3050: Computer Architecture

This is one of the most challenging courses I took during my undergraduate life.

It is featured with heavy coding workload and low level architecture knowledge.

As a tyro in programing at the time, I still remember how struggle it was to complete the projects on one's own.

I would like to share my implementation for project 3 and 4, since I was not doing very well in project 1 and 2. The deduction in project 3 was caused by some mistakes of instruction implementations.
- [Project 3](proj3/Project_3_Instruction.pdf): 91/100
- [Project 4](proj4/Project_4_Instruction.pdf): 110/100

I hope this would help you get some ideas about the projects.

Good Luck!
